      <p>My name is Yosmeily Collado. I am a full time student at Lehman college and I am a transfer student from LaGuardia Community College. My major is Computer Science. During my time in college, I have learned Java and some of C++.  </p>
      <p>In my opinion an engineer is a person who build, create or fix. </p1>
      <p>I have worked in some projects including Database and finance using java. However, I would like to work on more projects in particular Front-end which I call it, the colorful side of programming.</p>
